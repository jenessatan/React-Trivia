# CPSC 436I - Assignment 4

Task: Integrate Frontend and Backend with Node and Express
- initial data should be loaded using GET request to server, getting messages from Mongo DB
- add new message using PUT or POST and store in Mongo DB
- one additional server request, for example:
  - editing existing message
  - clearing list of messages
  - getting details for a message
- handle async calls (if done in action, use redux-thunk)
- something cool and extra, for example:
  - some kind of new component
  - a spinner while making a request (until it finishes)
  - some more advanced styling (animations or transition)
  - as listed above, editing a message
